# GBC-Long-read-Transcriptome
##A Novel ERBB2 Alternative Splicing Variant Induces Drug Resistance in Gallbladder Cancer Revealed by Long-read Transcriptome Sequencing

we employed the advanced long-read full-length transcriptome sequencing technology on GBC, normal tissues, and cell lines to establish a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas. One isoform with a novel exon was identified designated as ERRB2 i14e in multiple independent GBC datasets involving 179 GBC cases and the expression of ERRB2 i14e was associated with disease worse prognosis.
